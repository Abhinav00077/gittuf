# Contributing Guide

Contributions to gittuf can be of several types:
* changes to the design documents stored in the `docs/` folder
* code changes for bug fixes, new features, documentation, and other
  enhancements to the implementation
* new issues or feature requests

## Contributor Workflow

When submitting changes to the gittuf docs or implementation, contributors must
open a GitHub pull request to the repository. gittuf uses the NYU Secure
Systems Lab
[development workflow](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/lab-guidelines/blob/master/dev-workflow.md).
Pull requests undergo review by one or more [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.txt) and
undergo automated testing such as:
* Unit and build testing
* Static analysis using linters

In future, as gittuf matures, this repository will also be secured using gittuf.
At that point, the contributor workflow may evolve to record gittuf specific
information.
