# gittuf

This project provides a new security layer for Git, built using
[The Update Framework (TUF)](https://theupdateframework.io/).  It includes 
the ability to distribute and revoke keys, protect commits / branches / tags,
and more!

## Current Status

gittuf is currently a pre-pre-alpha. It is NOT intended for use in anything
remotely resembling a production system or repository. Contributions are
welcome!

The original prototype of gittuf has been archived. You can find it
[here](https://github.com/adityasaky/gittuf/tree/archived-prototype). The
takeaways from the prototype have been incorporated into our
[design document](docs/specification.md), and development going forward will
use this document as a foundation.
